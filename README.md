<h4 align="center">A small little app that monitors the activation state of your Mac's webcam and triggers HTTP(S) requests.</h4>


This is a simple app that is designed to send a HTTP request to a URL wehen the usage state of the computer's webcam changes.

The primary use case for this is to integrate it with homebridge-http-webhooks and provide an occupancy or motion sensor to trigger scenes.
